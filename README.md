# Downloads Pocs from GitHub

The famous repository
[PoC-in-GitHub](https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub) hosts a bunch of
json files describing every poc found for known CVEs. This tools allows us to
download their latest version as a zip file.

The repository is not clone because:

* I did not need the full history
* It takes far less space on disk

Envoy working offline ;-) !
